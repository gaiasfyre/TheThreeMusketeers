# The Three Musketeers

An Entity Academy Data Science Final Project Repository

**Project Title**

Wine Quality Analysis of Vinho Verde Red Wines

**Project Description** ***Want to use objective section of Proposal for this section***

This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

    What your application does,
    Why you used the technologies you used,
    Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

**How to Use the Project**

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

Georgia:
This project was an evaluation of the Vinho Verde Wines to understand what variables affected quality the most and what ratio of most effictive variables differentiate wine from being poor, average or good.
The data can be used for basic understanding of the ratio for the variables in the wine data set to how they affect quality, as well as which vaiables tend to affect quality the most.

Due to small sample size, the analysis of data may not be accurate in relation to actual quality of the wine. The data might be skewed due to previous cleaning of data from former user. Due to age of data, physiochemical properties might have changed. The classification is skewed due to inbalance, there are more normal wines than excellent or poor.

**Credits**

Autumn: For the credits section, I really like the credits to the 3 of us as they are written with the GitHub links---then maybe name our data science mentor and instructor for advisement and oversight (their GitHubs too if they don't mind.). For the resources, I would have a link to click to the project references page so the resources we used are available but also don't overshadow the 3 of us since the list is quite lengthy (I know we'll probably have to decide tomorrow how we're going to organize the folders so we can remove our personal folders before final presentation and start linking our READ ME).
