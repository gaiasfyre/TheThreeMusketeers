    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this document is to outline the flow and outcome of this project. This project will explore the quality of Vinho Verde wines within a region and select the more relevant physiochemical features that contribute to wine quality and in which ways. The assumption is that when wine quality is assessed and refined to produce more quality wines, sales within the region will increase. While assessing the sales data within the region is outside of the scope of this project, that is the assumption that is being made here. The one limitation of this project is that the wines sampled in this data excerpt are more reflective of normal wines, than excellent or poor.\n",
    "To conduct this analysis, the first portion will be feature selection using stepwise binary logistic regression. Once the features are selected, the second portion of this project will be using classification to assess the individual features' effect on the quality. This project will require a project manager to ensure the project is moving along, a scrum master to make sure hurdles are overcome, a few data analysts to do some exploratory analysis, a few data scientists to make sure the machine learning model is robust and data visualization is accurate, and a business analyst to make sure that the project is meeting the requirements of the business.\n",
    "The limitations of this project are there not being data on grape types, wine brand, or price point. The dataset is also limited in terms of size and the project deadline is somewhat limited. Risks are similar to the limitations within an addition of the dataset being imbalanced towards normal quality wines and the dataset being somewhat outdated (from 2009) so the physiochemical features back then might be different than they are today due to the effects of climate change."

    "Autumn: Quality evaluation is part of the wine certification process, a process assessed through physicochemical and sensory tests.  Knowledge gained by identifying the most influential factors in wine quality can improve wine making and help determine relative price points, distinguishing premium brands from average or lower quality brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the process seems straightforward, the relationships between the physicochemical and sensory analysis bear much complexity and are not fully understood.  Wine tasting is a mitigating factor in this process, a crucial component in the certification and quality recognition, yet taste is the least understood of the human senses.  This makes wine classification an even more daunting task.\n",
    "Though there is potential in predicting wine quality based on physicochemical data, before the original ‘Modeling Wine Preferences’ data mining project in 2009, predicting wine quality based on physicochemical data was limited.  The potential for integrating such techniques and unearthing data trends and patterns could vastly improve wine makers’ decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the rarity of red wine produced in the Minho region, we look to focus our efforts exclusively on the Vinho Verde red portion of the data set of 1599 cases, which will further reduce to 1143 cases once the data is cleaned and wrangled.  Through this process, we aim to build a successful model for evaluating which physicochemical properties have the most significant influence on the quality of wine.\n",
    "Our evaluation questions and methodology are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation question 1.  Which physiochemical properties of wine show the greatest significance and impact on wine quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology for answering evaluation question 1.  To answer this first question, we intend to conduct an ordinal logistic regression to evaluate the effect of 11 independent (continuous) variables on wine quality (dependent, ordinal variable).  Previous regression models we have explored use stepwise/binary logistic regression.  As a data science team, we felt this was a disservice to the data by grouping quality data that was initially ranked on an 11-point scale (0-10) into only two groups.  We believe that grouping the quality, ranging from 3-8 in these data values, is a better approach to assessing the data (quality rating 3-4: below average, 5-6: average or good, 7-8: above average). \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation question 2.  For the properties (variables), if any, that show the most significant impact on wine quality, what balance or interplay between these variables is necessary for the best quality wine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology for answering evaluation question 2.  To answer evaluation question 2, we will use the ordinal logistic regression results to build a model to run a discriminant functional analysis.  From that model, we anticipate a clearer idea of the variables that play a significant role in the quality and the optimal balance between these properties that lead to producing the greatest quality Vinho Verde red wine."

    "Portugal is the fifth largest wine producer in Europe and the eleventh largest in the world.  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Portugal's wine exports grew by 5% compared to the previous year.  More than 306 million liters of wine were exported during that period, valued at $936 million.  In 2021, Portuguese wines grew an additional 3.8% in volume, 8.6% in value, and 4.6% in average price from the same reporting period in 2020. \n",
    "The country boasts 14 renowned wine regions for quality wine production.  Because of the increasing value of Portuguese wine, in competition with France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany, the Ministry of Agriculture has honed its focus on monitoring farmers and producers to define and implement necessary measures to guarantee predictability and stability in Portuguese wine production.  Wine certification and quality assessment are key elements within this context. \n",

    "Vinho Verde hails from a small region, Minho, nestled in Northern Portugal.  Minho is particularly known for its bright, summery white wines with subtle carbonation.  However, red and rosé Vinho Verde wines are the region's rarer gem.  The cool and rainy climate in Minho makes it a bit more difficult to ripen the red Vinhão and even rarer Padeiro grapes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of data surrounding red wine quality, particularly in the Minho region of Portugal, coupled with initiatives to be a larger regional and global competitor in the wine export industry, as data scientists, we recognize the opportunity available for winemakers to capitalize on this data, improve decision making processes, and bring these rare red wines to more tables across the globe.\n",

    "Here we address limitations for consideration upon review of the project proposal. In terms of running the selected analyses, the data scientists involved in the project have not previously completed projects that required ordinal logistic regression or discriminant function analysis. To plan around these obstacles, data scientists have devoted time to researching the processes and gathering sound, published, and peer-reviewed resources in anticipation of the project. Data scientists have consulted with their data science mentor and instructor before the project proposal phase to gather additional feedback and guidance.\n",

Data scientists have each blocked time throughout the six-week process to work on this data science project. There are, however, blocks of time in which data scientists do not have the immediate availability to consult via Zoom or Slack if a question or issue arises. To counterbalance this issue, data scientists look to practice great diligence at the beginning of each workday to summarize their goals and availability for the day, so one can expect when another can answer or when to expect progress. A variety of tasks will also be published at the beginning of each week, in which a team member can pick up another card to work on while awaiting a response from the team/scrum master.\n",

    "Risks are anticipated in this project, but the data science team has discussed such concerns to mitigate them and work through them when possible.  The initial perils come with the dataset itself.  In the project selection process, we chose the red Vinho Verde data from the original dataset; the red wine is not as readily produced in the Minho region due to the cool, wet climate the area experiences.  Because of this, excellent red wines are harder to find in this region.  The red dataset has fewer samples (1599 vs. 4098) than the white Vinho Verde wine samples.  The quality scale in our dataset is also highly imbalanced.  There are far more average or ‘normal’ wines than poor or above-average ones.\n",

    "Another risk the team has considered concerns is the analyses and outside factors we may not have control over (i.e., illness on the team or other acute emergencies that could disturb the project). Time may run out before the team can complete all of the portions of the project, considering the added tightened timeline after the previous separation.  The data science team has taken great care in the secondary planning phases of this second project to allow for any obstacles that should be temporarily reassigned as necessary until the team member can return to the project."
